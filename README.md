# Homework-2-GCD-LCM
Homework 2
===
For this homework you will be computing:
* Greatest Common Denominator (GCD) or GCF
* Least Common Multiple (LCM)

You will compute these on 2 integers that are inut from stdin using cin.

GCD
==
The GCD can be implemented many ways. You may refer to:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm
Under implementations section their is pseduo code to may be used to help write your code. 

`Hint: Recursive method is the most compact form.`

LCM
===
The LCM can also be implemented in different ways. You may refer to:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple
Under calculations sections their examples.

`Hint: Implement the GCD method first and use it in the lcm calculation.`

Tasks:
===
1. Obtain 2 integers from stdin using cin (provided for you).
2. Implement the gcd function.
3. Implement the lcm function.
4. Be sure the test cases pass.
5. Submit
